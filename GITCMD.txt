To view the current status of the repo (i.e. if you have pending changes or something)
git status

To view the commit history and get commit hashcodes (useful for reverting stuff, use the Q key to get out of the list if you see : at the bottom of screen)
git log

To pull the repo
git pull

To add files to a new commit do the following
git add SomeDirectory/SomeFile.ccp 

You can add multiple files by using hotcards such as * and . or by just adding more paths like so: git add SomeDir/SomeFile1.ccp SomeDir/SomeFile.h

Now you need to create a "commit" by doing this:
git commit -m "yourname: your message"

Use the -m flag to add a message, i like to add my  name to the message and the general gist of the changes, easy to keep track of shit that way

Now you can push the commit by doing this
git push

Now you should be set, if you get errors, read them carefully as they are very descriptive :-)
